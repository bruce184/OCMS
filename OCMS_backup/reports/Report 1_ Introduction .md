# **3\. Product Background** {#3.-product-background}

## **3.1. Current status and trends in online education in Vietnam.**  {#3.1.-current-status-and-trends-in-online-education-in-vietnam.}

- In the post-COVID-19 period, the global e-learning market continues to accelerate. Aggregated data indicate that online education is expected to grow by more than 200 % in just 2020 – 2025—many reports view this as evidence that the sector is “no longer slowing down” after the pandemic push \[3\].  
- In Vietnam, the online-education market is valued at an estimated **USD 364.7 million in 2024** and is projected to grow at a **compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.46 %** through 2029, reaching **USD 627.4 million** \[5\]. The higher-education sub-segment alone could add another **USD 528.6 million** during 2023 – 2028 with a **CAGR of 15.43 %** \[6\]. Looking at the broader EdTech landscape, Vietnam’s e-learning sector was forecast to hit **USD 3 billion by 2023**, thanks to a compound growth rate of roughly 20 % per year (2019 – 2023\) \[7\].  
- This robust growth is further driven by a strong digital infrastructure. Smartphone penetration has already exceeded **84 %**, and Vietnam aims for **100 % smartphone adoption by the end of 2024** \[2\]; meanwhile, Internet penetration reached **79.1 % of the population** in early 2024, ensuring stable high-resolution online-class connections \[1\].  
- COVID-19 experience reinforces the trend: during lockdowns, up to **80 % of Vietnamese students could access online lessons**, and many institutions now maintain blended/hybrid models as the new norm for flexible teaching \[4\].  
- Thus, the convergence of (1) demand for flexible learning, (2) a double-digit EdTech growth rate, (3) strong telecommunications infrastructure, and (4) digital-transformation experience gained after the pandemic has created an unmistakable “perfect storm” for an **Online Course Management System (OCMS)**. Deploying an OCMS will not only meet current training-management needs but also anticipate future trends, delivering competitive advantages and a superior experience for faculty and students over the coming decade.

The authors stress that an LMS not only stores course content but also **enriches the learning experience** through assessment tools, discussion forums and multimedia resources; without these components, *“student satisfaction and learning motivation fall sharply”* \[8\].

### **3.2.2 Practical needs in higher education** {#3.2.2-practical-needs-in-higher-education}

- In August 2024, **VNU-HCM** and USAID ran the university’s **first intensive MOOC-design workshop**, described as *“a cornerstone”* of its 2023-2027 Digital-Transformation Plan \[9\]. Scaling such MOOCs **requires a robust course-management platform**—one that supports authoring, delivery and performance analytics for large-scale online teaching.

### **3.2.3. Technology-deployment perspective** {#3.2.3.-technology-deployment-perspective}

- An **international education provider** commissioned **AgileTech Vietnam** to build an **all-in-one LMS** that lets instructors create courses, share resources, grade learners and foster community interaction on a custom, scalable architecture \[10\]. AgileTech’s cost analysis shows that a tailored LMS can range from **USD 10 000 to 100 000**, depending on feature complexity; nevertheless, it is deemed a worthy investment for a **flexible, deeply integrable platform** \[11\].

### **3.2.4. Business and corporate-training perspective** {#3.2.4.-business-and-corporate-training-perspective}

- A report by **NobleProg**—a global IT-training provider with a Vietnam branch—notes that **government agencies, universities and enterprises widely adopt LMSs** to manage, deliver and track digital-learning programmes; LMS setup and administration courses are consistently among the best-selling offerings in Vietnam \[12\].

### **3.2.5. Evidence from Vietnamese enterprises** {#3.2.5.-evidence-from-vietnamese-enterprises}

- **ITD Vietnam**, a leading talent-development and corporate-training firm, employs an LMS to **centrally manage Leadership-Development programmes** for both internal staff and external clients, enabling performance measurement, personalised learning paths and rapid scaling of online training \[13\].

### **3.2.6. Conclusion** {#3.2.6.-conclusion}

- Taken together, the **academic evidence**, the **pressing digital-transformation agenda of universities**, and **real-world operational demands** demonstrate that an **integrated Online Course Management System** is the key solution to current training-management challenges: it simultaneously **enhances learner experience** and **delivers the flexibility and customisability** required by educational institutions and businesses across Vietnam.

* **Mobile Responsiveness:** Optimized for web access with mobile compatibility, allowing users to access the system on various devices, including smartphones and tablets.

The system will support both fully online and blended learning models, prioritizing ease of use, accessibility, and compliance with Vietnamese educational standards and regulations. It will be developed using a structured methodology, such as the Waterfall model, and leverage technologies like PHP Laravel or similar frameworks to ensure robustness and maintainability (ResearchGate, 2019).

## **4.2. Limitations** {#4.2.-limitations}

To maintain focus and feasibility, the project will have the following limitations:

* **Exclusions:** The system will not include advanced or specialized features unless explicitly required, such as:  
  * AI-driven personalization (e.g., adaptive learning paths tailored to individual student needs).  
  * Real-time video conferencing or live streaming capabilities for synchronous learning.  
  * Dedicated mobile app development (the system will be web-based only, with mobile responsiveness).  
  * Support for physical classroom bookings or hybrid event management.  
  * Advanced features like gamification, virtual reality (VR), or augmented reality (AR) integration.  
* **Manual Processes:** Certain administrative tasks may remain manual due to institutional policies or regulatory constraints in Vietnam, including:  
  * Verification of payment receipts, as students may need to submit official receipts manually to comply with institutional policies (UKEssays.com, 2025).  
  * Access to sensitive student data, such as financial reports or personal information, which may be restricted by university policies or Vietnamese data protection laws.  
* **Course Types:** The system will primarily support standard online courses (e.g., academic courses, professional training) and may not accommodate highly specialized or non-standard learning formats, such as vocational training or highly interactive simulations, without additional development.  
* **Performance Constraints:** While designed to be scalable, the system’s performance will be limited by the chosen infrastructure. It will be optimized to handle up to 1,000 concurrent users, but larger institutions may require infrastructure upgrades to maintain performance (GeeksforGeeks, 2024).  
* **Regulatory Compliance:** The system must comply with Vietnamese data protection laws and educational regulations, which may impose restrictions on data handling, user privacy, and content delivery. For example, certain student data may not be accessible to administrators due to privacy regulations.  
* **Technical Constraints:** Development will be constrained by available technologies and resources, potentially limiting the inclusion of cutting-edge features like VR, gamification, or advanced analytics unless specified in the requirements. Additionally, challenges such as connectivity issues or lack of technical training in some Vietnamese institutions may impact system adoption (SCIRP, 2019).  
* **Environmental Challenges:** In some Vietnamese educational institutions, particularly in rural areas, issues like unreliable internet connectivity, limited access to modern devices, or lack of technical training may hinder the system’s effectiveness, as noted in similar contexts (SCIRP, 2019).

These limitations ensure that the project remains focused on delivering a robust and functional OCMS that meets the core needs of educational institutions in Vietnam while managing expectations regarding what the system can and cannot do. Any proposed features outside this scope will be evaluated for their benefits and potential impact on the project’s budget, schedule, and resources.
